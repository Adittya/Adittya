ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Adittya

- I'm a second year student at the University of Texas at Austin, studying Physics with a concentration in Computation.
- My interests include Quantum Information Science, Quantum Algorithm Design, and Quantum Machine Learning
- I like to write a lot of my code in Python, specifically using the Qiskit and Pennylane libraries, along with some scientific computation

I am always looking to take on new challenges for Quantum Computationally related projects! Contact me at adittya.patil [at] utexas [dot] edu or patiladittya1428 [at] gmail [dot] com.
