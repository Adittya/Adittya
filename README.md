ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Adittya Patil

- I am currently an R&D Software Engineer on the Quantum Engineering Solutions team at Keysight Technologies. I write software that turns an arbitrary set of wires and electronics into a control system for quantum computers.
- I'm a recent graduate of the University of Texas at Austin with a B.S. in Physics with certificates in Scientific Computation & Data Sciences and Quantum Information Science.
- My interests include various topics in Quantum Computation (primarily Architecture, Error Correction, and Algorithms) and the applications of HPC.


I'm always looking to take on new challenges for new related projects! Contact me at adittya [dot] patil [at] utexas [dot] edu or patiladittya1428 [at] gmail [dot] com.
